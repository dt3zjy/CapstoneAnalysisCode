# CapstoneAnalysisCode
This is a repository of all of the code that I created when I revisited my capstone project for a deeper dive into the analysis process. It is split into two folders: original_nozzle and optimized_nozzle

## Details
Each folder contains 3 different Python Notebooks. Each of these notebooks have a description when the file is viewed. The .csv contains all of the pressure values along the axial length of the nozzle calculated using the isentropic flow relations. The folder "... Nozzle Exit Data" contains the exit conditions taken directly from a CFD simulation to be used within the []_thrust_calc.ipynb file.
